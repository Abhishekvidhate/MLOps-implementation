## why __init__.py files are empty ?

The __init__.py file serves a specific purpose in Python packages. Let’s explore it:
 - When Python encounters a directory containing an __init__.py file, it treats that directory as a package.
 - A package is a way to organize related Python modules into a single directory hierarchy.
 - The __init__.py file can be empty, but its presence signifies that the directory should be treated as a package.
 - When you import a module from a package, Python executes the __init__.py file (if it exists) to initialize the package.
 - You can use the __init__.py file to perform initialization tasks, set variables, or define submodules.

 
Essentially, it’s a way to structure your code and make it more modular and organized.

**In summary, the __init__.py file is essential for Python to recognize a directory as a package( so we can later import it's classes to perform taks), even if it doesn’t contain any code. ** 
It’s a convention that helps maintain consistency and allows you to create well-structured

## what is materializer ?
In the context of MLops (Machine Learning Operations),
a materializer is a component responsible for materializing or persisting artifacts generated during the machine learning workflow. 
These artifacts could include trained models, feature transformers, evaluation metrics, etc. 
The custom_materializer.py file contains custom logic or implementations related to persisting or managing these artifacts.

In simple terms, 
materializer is a component responsible for creating and managing data artifacts.
These artifacts could be datasets, features, or other data-related resources.
